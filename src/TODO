Ruler 90° einrasten

Rightclick as defined Tool: Selection is not working
>Using rectangle select as middle mouse button (pen button) doesn't work.

Deselect Tool should not be possibel

2) Undo seems to redraw in 2 steps, separated by a second or two, and a crash
always soon follows.

3) The Autosave/restore needs a UI.

4) After strokes are drawn they are re-drawn, it appears with slightly different
width or anti-aliasing.

7) All the different types of toolbars needs to be cleaned up...

8) The added grey borders are not useful, IMHO it's just wasted screen space.
Also the red border around the active page is not needed, I think.  I assume
this is because you want to know which page is "active" for e.g. pasting.  I
never had any trouble with xournal this way.

10) Some UI elements are now focusable with the keyboard (e.g. zoom slider).
Long ago I submitted a patch that made all UI elements send focus back to the
canvas so that the arrow keys on the bezel of tablet pc's would always scroll
the page instead of e.g. changing the zoom when a UI element is focused.



Scrollen mit Stift ist schwammig (warum?)
! Radieren Normaler Modus auch
! Schieben hängt teilweise auch
Wenn man "ausserhalb der Seite" scrollen darf ist der initiale Scrollwert falsch bei (0/0)
